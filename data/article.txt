Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) is the delivery of television content over Internet. With cable or satellite TV, broadcasters send out signals and viewers receive them—you’re only able to watch what’s being broadcasted. IPTV is different. Instead of transmitting content via light pulses in fiber-optic cable or radio waves from a satellite, IPTV sends shows and movies through your standard internet connection.[1]

1. What is IPTV?

In its simplest form, IPTV delivers television content over a closed network using the Internet Protocol (IP) instead of traditional satellite TV or cable TV formats.

This means that instead of your television provider sending a signal to your TV via a physical cable, that signal is instead sent over the internet. This has a few advantages – most notably, it allows you to view television content anywhere you have an internet connection.

It also opens up new possibilities regarding content delivery, Interactivity, and impossible features with traditional television formats.

2. How does IPTV work?

IPTV is a video-streaming technology that delivers television programs over the internet. IPTV provides television content using the internet protocol suite instead of being delivered through traditional terrestrial, satellite signal, or cable television formats.

IP-based television allows for a more customized experience for users. It also enables service providers to offer more features such as video on demand (VOD), interactive applications, and games. In addition, IPTV can be integrated with other types of broadband services, such as internet telephony and data over cable service (DOCSIS).
